When to use if else and when to use exception-->

We should use if else only when we check conditions. 
If Else should not be used when we have to handle statements we know are crucial and can lead to error. 
Hence, for handling statements which will lead to error and can cause big problems one should use exception handling andnot if else.
If else should be used to throw exceptions.
